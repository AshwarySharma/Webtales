            Overview
        </div><br>
        <p class="always_body">
            Japanese culture is ancient and is filled with rites 
            and traditions to honor the family. Because Japan is an
            island country, it was able to moderate the influence of 
            other cultures for centuries. This allowed a distinct culture
             and heritage to develop for the beautiful Land of the Rising Sun.

            With important rites of passage, festivals of celebration, and unique dress
            and style, details from the lives of your Japanese ancestors will brighten
            your family stories.

            Cultural Rite of Passage
        </div><br><br>
        <p class="always_body">
            Hatsu Miyamairi, or Omiyamairi, meaning “shrine visit,” is a precious family 
            tradition for the close loved ones of a newborn baby. Parents or grandparents 
            bring the baby to a Shinto shrine for this special rite of passage. Traditionally 
            done 31 days after the birth of a boy and 33 days after the birth of a girl, this 
            Japanese Shinto tradition shows gratitude for the birth of the child.

            Babies are dressed in a white kimono or special white dress and are most often carried by
            their grandmother. The shrine priest says a prayer for the health and happiness of the newborn.

            Coming of Age Day
        </div><br><br>
        <p class="always_body">
            Seijin no Hi, or Coming of Age Day, is another rite 
            of passage in Japanese culture. It welcomes into adulthood 
            those who have turned age 20 and is held each year on the
             second Monday in January.

            Seijin no Hi has been practiced in Japan since AD 714, when a young 
            prince dressed in new robes and changed his hairstyle to reflect his 
            passage into adulthood.

            On this celebration day, new adults gather and enjoy encouraging speeches 
            from government officials.<br><br><hr><hr><hr>

                The Obon Festival
            </div><br><br>
            <p class="always_body">
                The Obon festival is a way the Japanese honor their ancestors.
                 This three-day summer festival has been celebrated for more than 
                 500 years and takes place in July or August.

                This Japanese Buddhist tradition encourages people to return to their ancestral
                family home places and clean and visit the graves of their ancestors.
                The spirits of the ancestors are said to revisit the family altars. 
                Gifts of food, alcohol, and flowers are often left on the gravestone 
                and altar as a respectful gesture to those who have passed away.

         <div class="speciallity">
            Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) 
            is also the country's highest mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise 
            largely flat landscape to the south and east, this majestic and fabled mountain is tall e
            nough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.

Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so 
important an icon that UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the 
Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is climbed by more than a million people each summer as
 an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from its summit.

While some still choose to begin their climb from the base, the majority of climbers now start from 
above the halfway mark, at the 5th Station, resulting in a more manageable six-or-so-hour ascent. 
Those who do attempt the complete climb are advised to depart in the afternoon, breaking up the climb 
with an overnight stop at one of the "Mountain Huts" designed for this very purpose. An early start the 
next day gets you to the top for the sunrise.

Of course, for many, simply viewing the mountain from the distance, or from the comfort of 
a speeding train, is enough to say "been there, done that."

        <div class="speciallity">
            Tokyo's most famous landmark, the Imperial Palace with its beautiful 
            17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats, is a must-see when 
            visiting the nation's capital. Don't be put off by the fact that the 
            majority of the palace is closed to the public (it's still in use by the
            Imperial family), as there is still enough to see simply by strolling the grounds.

In addition to the many fine views of the palace from numerous points in the surrounding
 parkland, visitors are permitted into the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden and other areas 
 that are opened to the public as part of an organized tour. One of the most romantic
  views is of the famous Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge," so named for its watery r
  eflection.

Another one of the must-sees for tourists visiting Tokyo is the famous Ginza shopping 
district. This always bustling area is home to the Kabuki-za Theatre with its Kabuki
 performances, as well as the Shimbashi Enbujo Theatre with its traditional Azuma-odori 
 dances and Bunraku performances.

            While little needs to be said here of the horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945,
             much can be said of the incredible efforts this vibrant city has made to commemorate the many 
             victims of the world's first nuclear attack. Perhaps even more importantly, Hiroshima has become
              a symbol of lasting peace.

Visited by more than a million people each year, many from overseas, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (Hiroshima
 Heiwa Kinen Kōen) lies at the epicenter of the atomic blast in what was once a bustling part of the city. 
 Here you'll find a number of important monuments, memorials, and museums relating to the events of that fateful day.

In addition to the grounds and gardens with their colorful cherry blossoms, the park is where you'll find 
the Peace Memorial Museum, with its numerous exhibits dealing with the issue of world peace. It's also where 
you'll find the Memorial Cenotaph and the Flame of Peace, as well as the Atom Bomb Dome, the ruins of an 
administrative building that lay at the center of the explosion.

            Historic Kyoto
        </li>

        <div class="speciallity">
            One of Japan's most visited cities, lovely Kyoto - one of the few cities in the country to 
            be spared the devastation of WWII - attracts more than 10 million visitors annually. Most of them are here to explore Kyoto's fine old streets and architecture, much of it unchanged since the Imperial family took up residence here more than 1,000 years ago.

Even then, the city was Japan's most important cultural center.
 This legacy, in fact, continues to this day with its many 
 museums and art galleries, each bursting with important sculptures, 
 paintings, and other art forms.

Highlights of Kyoto's Buddhist-influenced architecture include its
many well-preserved temples, 30 of which are still in use, and important 
structures such as the 14th-century Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), famous
 for its exquisite gold-leaf-clad exterior.

Be sure to also visit Nijo Castle, a 17th-century fortress
 that has retained its original walls, towers, and moat. Also 
 worth seeing are the castle's beautiful gates, along with its 
 palace with fine interior décor.

Another landmark to visit is the original Kyoto Imperial Palace 
(Kyoto-gosho). Built in AD 794, it's one of the city's most visited 
historic sites.

Finally, no visit to Kyoto is complete without spending time exploring 
the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. This beautiful area of tall bamboo is just 
a few minutes' walk from the town center.

            The Island Shrine of Itsukushima
        </li>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/JPN/japan-attractions-hiroshima-itsukushima.jpg" height=500 width= auto class="image">
        <div class="speciallity">
            Just a short ferry ride from mainland Hiroshima 
            is the island of Miyajima, famous the world over
             as Japan's Shrine Island. Covering an area of 30
             square kilometers in Hiroshima Bay, Miyajima is best
             known as the home of the Itsukushima Shrine, a Shinto
              temple dedicated to the Princess daughters of the wind 
              god Susanoo.

Dating from the eighth century, the majority of the shrine's buildings 
rise out of the waters of a small bay supported only by piles. The effect
 at high tide is simply stunning, making these structures - including the 
 famous Great Floating Gate (O-Torii) - appear as if they're floating on water.

Linked together by walkways and bridges, it's a fascinating place to explore
, in particular its larger halls. These include the exquisite Honden (Main Hall),
 the Offerings Hall (Heiden), the Prayer Hall (Haiden), and the Hall of a Thousand Mats (Senjokaku).

Another notable feature is the shrine's stage, where visitors are entertained with 
traditional dances and musical performances. Also worth exploring are the island's 
exquisite grounds and gardens, home to wild deer and numerous bird colonies.

Please note: You can expect some interruptions and inconvenience from now until 2022
 due to major renovations taking place at this historic site.

            Overview of Technology

        <p class="always_body">
            Science and technology in Japan has developed rapidly after the Second World War,
             which has affected the advancement of vehicle technology, consumer electronics,
              robotics, medical devices, space exploration, and the film industry. Japan's focus 
              on intensive mathematics education and the reverence for engineers in Japanese culture
               aids engineering talent development, which has produced advances in automotive engines,
                television display technology, videogames, optical clocks, and many other fields.
                 Japan is also advanced in robotics, restaurants, and hospitals. Japan was ranked 
                 16th in the Global Innovation Index in 2020, down from 15th in 2019.

            Geography of Japan
        </div><br><br>
        <p class="always_body">
            Japan is an island country comprising a stratovolcanic 
            archipelago over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) along East Asia's
             Pacific coast. It consists of 6,852 islands The 
             five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku 
             and Okinawa. There are 6,847 remote islands.The Ryukyu
              Islands and Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands.

The territory covers 377,975.26 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi).It is the fourth 
largest island country in the world and the largest island country in East Asia.
 The country has the 6th longest coastline at 29,751 km (18,486 mi) and the
 8th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi) in the 
 world.

The terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous with 66% forest. The
 population is clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys.
  Japan is located in the northwestern Ring of Fire on multiple tectonic 
 plates. East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches. The Japan Trench is 
 created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate.
 The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunami and stratovolcanoes.
 The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese 
 archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the Asian continent
  by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.

The climate varies from humid continental in the north to 
humid subtropical 
and tropical rainforest in the south. These differences in climate 
and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and
 fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.

Japan extends from 20° to 45° north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) 
and from 122° to 153° east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). Japan
 is surrounded by seas. To the north the Sea of Okhotsk separates it from the 
 Russian Far East, to the west the Sea of Japan separates it from the Korean 
 Peninsula, to the southwest the East China Sea separates the Ryukyu Islands
  from China and Taiwan, to the east is the Pacific Ocean.
